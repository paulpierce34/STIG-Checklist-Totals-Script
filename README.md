# STIG-Checklist-Totals-Script
Powershell script created with the intention of being ran against a directory of STIG checklists that will output the total amount of Cat I, Cat II, Cat III vulnerabilities, as well as their status.

If you've worked for the DoD and have to STIG anything or keep track of the STIG numbers for your organization, this script was made for you. It is a good way to compare raw numbers from checklists to whatever you're using to track said numbers.

Just another useful STIG tool to use imo if you're serious about tracking compliance.
