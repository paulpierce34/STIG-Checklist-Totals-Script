# STIG-Checklist-Totals-Script
Powershell script created with the intention of being ran against a directory of STIG checklists. The totals for Open and Not Applicable items will be summed up in comparison to the total amount of Cat I, Cat II, Cat IIIs there are in each checklist.

If you've worked for the DoD and have to STIG anything or keep track of the STIG numbers for your organization, this script was made for you. It is a good way to compare raw numbers from checklists to whatever you're using to track said numbers.

Just another useful STIG tool to use if you're serious about tracking compliance.

In future updates, I will be calculating the CCRI score % for each of the individual checklists in the output, and then provide a total summarized score at the top.
